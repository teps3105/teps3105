## What I do

System design & backend engineer.
Focused on decision boundaries, automation, and AI-aware systems.

## How I think

- Clear ownership over clever abstractions
- Decisions should be traceable and reversible
- AI is a tool, not an authority
- Systems should fail loudly, not quietly

## What I'm working on

- Personal infrastructure & homelab
- System design frameworks (Light / CRATE)
- Backend & automation tooling
